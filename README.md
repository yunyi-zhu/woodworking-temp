# Sit-on Shoe Rack

I made a shoe rack! I designed it for a nook in my old apartment, and it fits perfectly. :)

## Credits

This is my second woodworking project ever. During the process of making this shoe rack, I was constantly learning from <a href="https://studentlife.mit.edu/news/mit-hobby-shop-welcomes-hayami-arakawa-and-coby-unger" target="_blank">Hayami Arakawa</a> and <a href="https://www.cobyungerdesign.com/" target="_blank">Coby Unger</a>, who are the shop masters at <a href="https://studentlife.mit.edu/hobbyshop/contact-us/our-staff" target="_blank">MIT Hobby Shop</a>. They taught me everything from using a measuring tape to operating a planer. I'm incredibly grateful for the patience they had when teaching me their skills.

## Design

Since I was designing for a very small entrance nook that is directly connected some upwards stairs, there are several things that I took into consideration:

- The door should be able to open fully
- I should be able to reach my shoes easily when sitting on the stairs
- It should hide the clutter as much as possible

After several iterations, I settled on this design, which has several features:

- It has an upper side and a lower side, so that I can throw my bags onto the lower part very easily. The shoes also wouldn't be higher than my nose when I put on my shoes on the stairs (otherwise it wouldn't feel nice).
- The openings on the side allow me to reach the shoes easily when sitting on the stairs.
- I also planned to put some hooks on the sideboard, but I took them out because of the time constraint (I will just use 3M hooks).

For the aesthetics, the bevels on the molding were inspired by <a href="https://www.foureyesfurniture.com/shop-plans/desquire-desk-plans" target="_blank">The Desquire Desk from Foureyes Furniture</a>.

## Process

I started this project by cutting a sheet of 3/4'' maple plywood into pieces of the correct size (dimensions see the <a href="http://www.yunyizhu.info/woodworking/2_shoe-rack/shoe-rack-plan.pdf">plan</a>.

I then cut dados and rabbets on each piece so that the joint together into the correct shape.

I then glued them together. I glued the left section (larger part) on the first day, and the right section (smaller part) on the second day.

I then went on with the moldings. I milled some cherry lumber and cut them into strips.

Process of making the molding

I then glued all the molding pieces onto the frame.

Since I used rabbet joints instead of miter joints on the plywood part, there were some exposed plywood edges on the top plane of the rack. I covered them with the scraps from the beveled molding (the remaining tiny triangle part), and later sanded them down so that they only barely cover the plywood edges.

After sanding down the covering wood

I then attached the back panels (1/4'' maple plywood) with thin strips of ash (1/4'' by 1/4''). This is better than directly sticking the back panel into the frame because the glue wouldn't go to the inside of the rack.

After a lot of sanding, I put three layers of Danish Oil as finishing, and here's the final product (excluding the base). I then made a butt-joint base for it, and it's officially done!
